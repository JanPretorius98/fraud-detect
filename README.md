## Model Specification

The modeling process in this project involves setting up, training, and evaluating two distinct types of predictive models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The Random Forest is the main model of the report, but the Logistic model served as an initial starting point to scrutinise variables and their contributions to the prediction.

Here's a structured overview of the model setup:

### Random Forest Model:

| Aspect                          | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Feature Conversion              | Converts key features into factors to capture categorical nature within training and testing sets. |
| Model Configuration             | Trains using age, gender, amount_standardized, value_category, value_customer, and value_merchant as predictors. |
| Variable Importance             | Analyzes importance of each feature post-training.           |
| Optimal Threshold Determination | Uses `find_optimal_threshold` function to find the balance between false negatives and positives. |

### Logistic Regression Model:

| Aspect               | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Feature Selection    | Includes age, category, and interaction between amount_standardized and value_category as predictors. |
| Model Training       | Uses glm function with a binomial family to fit the model on the training data. |
| Threshold Adjustment | Predictions on test data with a probability threshold of 0.40 to classify transactions. |

### Model Evaluation:

| Metric              | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Confusion Matrix    | Generated for each model to evaluate performance based on the optimal threshold identified. |
| ROC Curve Analysis  | Plots ROC curves and calculates AUC to assess differentiation between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions (not included in the presentation). |
| Performance Metrics | Calculates accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. |

## Data Operations

This `eda.R` script is a comprehensive workflow for processing, analyzing, and modeling a dataset for fraud detection. Let's break down the operations carried out on the main dataframe `df` and the setup for training and testing data:

### Data Importing and Initial Processing:
- **load_df**: A custom function is invoked to load the dataset from a CSV file, with options to standardize numeric columns and impute missing values.
- **Data Cleaning**: The loaded `df` undergoes further cleaning to remove unwanted characters and filter out unknown gender values, converting them to a more readable format.

### Feature Engineering and Descriptive Statistics:
- **both_fraud**: A new binary feature is created to indicate transactions involving customers and merchants with a history of fraud.
- **Average Calculations**: The script calculates the average transaction amount by category, customer, and merchant, which may be used later to identify patterns or anomalies in the data.

### Data Augmentation and Categorization:
- **High Value Flags**: `df` is augmented with binary indicators that flag high-value categories, customers, and merchants based on their average transaction amounts, providing additional layers for analysis.

### Preparing Data for Modeling:
- Categorical variables within `df` are converted to factors, setting the stage for the subsequent model training.
- The data is then split into training and testing sets, ensuring a randomized and representative selection for model evaluation.

## Functions Overview

## Functions from [`transform.R`](code/transform.R)

### `impute_missing_values()`

**Purpose:** This function is designed to address missing values in a dataset, which is a common issue in data preparation. The imputation method can be tailored based on the needs of the analysis.

**Parameters:**

- `data`: The dataframe that contains the data.
- `method`: The method of imputation to use. Options include averaging within a group, drawing from a distribution within a group, or setting missing values to zero.
- `var`: The variable (column) in which to impute missing values.
- `group`: The group by which the imputation should be stratified.

**Intuition:**
- By imputing missing values, we can prevent the loss of data rows that could be critical for analysis.
- Group-based imputation allows for more accurate and representative value assignments compared to global methods, as it respects the inherent structure within the data.

### `standardise()`

**Purpose:** This function standardizes numerical variables, which is a common preprocessing step to normalize data for models that assume data is centered around zero with a standard deviation of one.

**Parameters:**
- `data`: The dataframe containing the data.
- `var`: The variable to be standardized.

**Intuition:**
- Standardization helps in comparing coefficients of variables that are on different scales and is crucial for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of data, such as k-NN, SVM, and neural networks.

### `load_df()`

**Purpose:** A comprehensive function to load, clean, and prepare the dataset for analysis. It includes steps to standardize the data, impute missing values, and create additional informative variables.

**Parameters:**

- `path`: The file path to the dataset.
- `standardise`: A flag to indicate if the numeric columns should be standardized.
- `impute_NA`: A flag to indicate if missing values should be imputed.

**Intuition:**
- The function encapsulates the entire data cleaning workflow, ensuring that the raw data is converted into a format that is suitable for analysis.
- Removing specific characters and filtering out unknown gender categories help to maintain data quality and consistency.
- The inclusion of categorical splitting and past fraud indicators enriches the dataset, providing more angles for insightful analysis.

## Functions from [`eda.R`](code/eda.R)

### `find_optimal_threshold()`

**Purpose:**
This function aims to find the optimal threshold for classifying fraud in a dataset by minimizing the average number of false negatives and false positives. It's a critical step to balance the trade-off between catching as many fraudulent transactions as possible (true positives) and not misclassifying legitimate transactions as fraud (false positives).

**Parameters:**

- `rf_model`: The trained Random Forest model object.
- `test_data`: The test dataset on which the model will make predictions.

**Intuition:**
- The function iterates over a range of threshold values from 0.7 to 0.01, decrementing by 0.01 with each iteration. For each threshold, it:
  - Predicts fraud using the current threshold value.
  - Constructs a confusion matrix based on these predictions.
  - Calculates the number of false negatives (fraudulent transactions predicted as non-fraudulent) and false positives (non-fraudulent transactions predicted as fraudulent).
  - Determines the average of false negatives and false positives for that threshold.
- If the calculated average is lower than what has been observed in previous iterations (stored in `min_average`), it updates `min_average` and sets the `optimal_threshold` to the current threshold value.
- After evaluating all thresholds, it returns the threshold that resulted in the lowest average of false negatives and false positives, thus providing a balanced approach to fraud detection.

**Use Case:**
This function is especially useful when the cost of false negatives (missed fraud) and false positives (legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraudulent) needs to be balanced. It's a fine-tuning step that follows model training to ensure that the model's predictions align well with business objectives and risk management strategies.

## Next Steps

### Questions for the bank

1. **Customer Segmentation and Product Usage:**
   - Can you provide insights into the criteria used for customer segmentation within the bank? How are products and services tailored to different segments?

2. **Account and Transaction Types:**
   - Could you explain the range of account types (e.g., savings, checking, loans) and transaction categories (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, transfers) included in the data? How do these account and transaction types relate to the bank's primary revenue streams?

3. **Geographical Influence:**
   - How does the bank's geographical presence affect account distribution and transaction volumes? Are there specific regions that show higher engagement or product uptake?

4. **Customer Retention and Churn Analysis:**
